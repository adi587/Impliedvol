# Impliedvol
After learning about the shortcomings of the Black Scholes (BS) model I wanted to see how implied volatility varies between equities and fx. To do this I use the same files from my previous Binomialoption repository, specifically to calculate implied volatiltiy given option strikes and prices.
# Volatility surface model and training
As there are only a discrete select set of option strikes traded on the markets I need to create a model that can predict option prices for all strikes and maturity dates given market data. For the model I draw from (Dumas, Fleming and Whaley 1996) paper: $IV=a_0+a_1K+a_2T+a_3K^2+a_4KT+a_5T^2$ where $IV,K,T$ is implied volatility, strike and time to maturity respectively. The $a_i$ coefficients are to be determined from training the model on historical data. This model is useful as the quadratic nature will capture the 'smiling' nature of IV without overfitting (as would be seen with higher order polynomials). The market data to train the model was downloaded online for various strikes and expiration dates (setting up an API to dynamically retrieve market information would be unnecessarily time consuming for the purpose of this project). The model was trained using a linear regressor (mean squared distance loss function) after transforming the features into polynomial features. 
# Analysis
I first constructed volatility surfaces for Amazon (AMZN) options. The price of stock at training was 129.12 USD. I set the risk free rate to 0.05 matching treasury bill yields. The dividends rate was set to 0 (An online search shows amazons low divedend rate). The risk free rate and dividends do not same to have much effect on the IV values and shape so I wasnt too worried about using exact figures. I selected a range of strikes and 5 different maturity dates (A total of 170 data points). To train the model I split the data as 0.8 for training and 0.2 for testing. The $R^2$ coefficient on train set was 0.84 and for test set it was $0.85$. This is a good coefficient of determination indicating the model does a good job at predicting the surfaces. I then plotted the surface for a range of points giving this 3D plot:

Note that the z-axis is the implied volatility. A clear curvature can be seen between the strike price and implied volatility. Also a less pronounced curve can be seen with the implied volatiltiy and time to maturity. To see this effect clearer IV is plotted again strike at for 1 month time to maturity and IV plotted against time at 133 strike.

First on the IV and strike relation, the orange dotted line is to show the stock price at time of training.
